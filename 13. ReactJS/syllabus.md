# The Ultimate 2026 React Syllabus: SDE2 to Staff+ (Complete Edition)

> **What changed for 2026?** AI/LLM integration is no longer optional—streaming token UIs are a standard expectation. React Router v7 has merged with Remix. Edge rendering is the default for modern frameworks. Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) has overtaken traditional folder structures. XState v5 is the gold standard for complex state.
>
> This edition folds in the original syllabus **plus a full gap-fill pass for Senior/SDE3 → Staff+ roles**: React internals (Fiber, Lanes, Scheduler), browser rendering pipeline fundamentals, GraphQL federation/DataLoader, advanced networking/protocols, concurrency beyond hooks, Staff+ "soft" technical skills, deeper testing strategies, and misc practical gaps (Web Components, design token pipelines, feature flag rollout strategy).
>
> Look for **🆕 [2026]** for original 2026 additions, and **🟣 [GAP-FILL]** for content added in this pass for senior/staff+ completeness.

# PART 2: REACT CORE CONCEPTS (SDE2)

## 2.1 Introduction to React
- What is React? Virtual DOM concept
- Component-based architecture
- JSX syntax and rules, reconciliation
- Expressions in JSX, conditional rendering
- React elements vs components
- **Strict Mode** – double invocation, detecting side effects

## 2.2 Components & Props

- Rendering flow & lifecycle methods (class) vs hooks (functional)
- Props vs State
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
- Keys in lists and reconciliation pitfalls
- Error Boundaries

- Lifting state up
- State management patterns (component state, app state)

## 2.4 Event Handling
- Synthetic events and pooling (React 17+ no pooling)
- Event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`)
- Passing arguments to event handlers
- Form handling basics
- **React 19**: `ref` as a prop (no more `forwardRef` needed)
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Synthetic event system internals** — how React delegates all events to the root container instead of attaching listeners per-DOM-node, and why this matters for event ordering with third-party libraries and portals

---

# PART 3: ESSENTIAL REACT HOOKS (SDE2 → SDE3)

## 3.1 Basic Hooks
- `useState` – with functional updates and batching
- `useEffect` – lifecycle simulation, cleanup, dependencies, stale closure solutions
- `useContext` – consuming context (React 19: `use` API alternative)
- `useRef` – DOM access, mutable values, previous value tracking

## 3.2 Additional Hooks (React 16.8 – 18)
- `useReducer` – complex state logic (when state transitions are interrelated)
- `useCallback` – memoizing functions, dependency array best practices
- `useMemo` – memoizing expensive computations
- `useImperativeHandle` – exposing child methods to parent
- `useLayoutEffect` – synchronous DOM mutations (before paint)
- `useDebugValue` – custom hook labeling in DevTools
- `useId` – stable IDs for accessibility (hydration-safe)
- `useTransition` – marking non-urgent updates, `isPending`
- `useDeferredValue` – deferring non-critical UI updates
- **`useSyncExternalStore`** (React 18) – subscribing to external stores (Redux, Zustand, browser APIs) with concurrency safety
- **`useInsertionEffect`** (React 18) – for CSS-in-JS dynamic style injection (avoids layout thrashing)

## 3.3 React 19+ Hooks
- **`useOptimistic`** – optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback
- **`useFormStatus`** – access form submission status without prop drilling
- **`useActionState`** – unified form state management with actions
- **`use` API** – read promises and context with Suspense (replaces `useContext` in some cases, works in conditionals/loops)

## 3.4 React Compiler (formerly "Forget")
- Automatic memoization – how it changes `useMemo`/`useCallback` best practices
- Compiler directives – `"use memo"`, `"use no memo"`
- Adoption strategy in existing codebases
- 🆕 **[2026] Understanding the React Signals Proposal** (How the Compiler maps to future React primitives)

## 3.5 Custom Hooks

- Hook composition and reuse
- Common patterns: `useDebounce`, `useThrottle`, `useLocalStorage`, `useFetch`, `usePrevious`, `usePolling`, `useWebSocket`, `useClickOutside`, `useIntersectionObserver`
- Rules of Hooks (call only at top level, only from React functions)

---

# PART 4: ADVANCED REACT CONCEPTS (SDE2 → SDE3)

## 4.1 Performance Optimization
- `React.memo` – component memoization, custom comparison function
- `useMemo` / `useCallback` optimization patterns (when to use, when to avoid)
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders: lifting state down, children as props, component composition
- Virtualized lists (`react-window`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`) for large datasets (10k+ rows)
- Code splitting: `React.lazy`, `Suspense`, dynamic imports
- Bundle splitting strategies – route-based, component-based, vendor splitting
- Tree-shaking and side effects configuration (`sideEffects: false`)
- Profiling with React DevTools (flamegraphs, ranked charts, interactions)
- **`Why Did You Render?`** library – tracking re-renders
- **Web Vitals** (LCP, CLS, INP, FID) optimization techniques
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Web Workers + Comlink** — offloading expensive computation (large sorts, image processing, parsing) off the main thread; using Comlink to make worker RPC feel synchronous
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] WASM integration with React** — using WebAssembly modules for perf-critical paths (codecs, crypto, simulation) and bridging results back into React state

## 4.2 Context API Advanced
- Creating and providing context
- Consuming with `useContext` (or `use` API in React 19)
- Performance pitfalls – one context re-renders all consumers
- Solutions: splitting contexts, memoizing value, selector-based context (using `useSyncExternalStore`)
- React 19: `Context` as a provider (no need for `Context.Provider`)

## 4.3 Refs and DOM Manipulation
- `useRef` for DOM access
- Forwarding refs – React 19: `ref` is a normal prop, no `forwardRef` needed
- Callback refs (when you need to know when a DOM node is attached/detached)
- 🆕 **[2026] Ref Cleanup Functions (React 19)** – returning a cleanup function from ref callbacks for `ResizeObserver`/`IntersectionObserver`
- Use cases: focus management, media playback, third-party library integration

## 4.4 Error Boundaries
- Creating error boundaries with `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch`
- Limitations: do not catch errors in event handlers, async code, or the error boundary itself
- Error recovery patterns (fallback UI, resetting state, logging to Sentry)
- **Hydration errors** – common causes and solutions

## 4.5 Suspense & Concurrent Features
- `Suspense` for code-splitting and data fetching
- Data fetching with Suspense – using `use` API or Relay/SWR
- Concurrent rendering: how React interrupts renders for high-priority updates
- `startTransition` and `useTransition` for non-urgent updates

---

- 🆕 **[2026] XState v5** – Actor-model based state machines. *Critical for 2026 SDE3 roles to manage complex, guaranteed state transitions (e.g., checkout flows, multi-step wizards).*
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] State normalization patterns** — flattening nested relational data (e.g., a list of posts each with a nested author and comments) into normalized `{ ids: [], entities: {} }` shape (normalizr-style) instead of storing deeply nested trees; why this avoids duplicate-data update bugs (updating an author's name in one place instead of N nested copies) and pairs naturally with `createEntityAdapter` in Redux Toolkit; a classic senior state-management interview question framed as "how would you store this API response"

## 7.2 Server State Management
- **TanStack Query (React Query) v5**
  - Queries and mutations
  - Cache management, `staleTime`, `gcTime`

- Headless UI components (Radix UI, Headless UI by Tailwind) – unstyled accessible components
- Building custom component libraries (Storybook, changesets)
- **Design tokens** – W3C format, Style Dictionary
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Figma-to-code / design token pipeline workflow** — designers export tokens (color, spacing, typography) from Figma → Style Dictionary transforms them into platform-specific outputs (CSS vars, JS objects, iOS/Android) → CI job keeps design and code in sync; versioning tokens alongside component library releases

## 8.3 Animation
- CSS Transitions/Animations with React

- Testing error boundaries
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW 2.0)** – intercept network requests at the service worker level
- 🆕 **[2026] Visual Regression Testing** – Chromatic, Percy, or Vercel Preview. *Crucial for Design Systems and senior roles to prevent UI drift.*
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Contract testing (Pact)** — verifying frontend/backend API contracts independently so either side can deploy without breaking the other; consumer-driven contract workflow
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Mutation testing (Stryker)** — measuring test suite quality by injecting small code mutations and checking if tests catch them; rare but does appear at some Staff+ interviews as a "how do you know your tests are good" probe
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Storybook interaction/play-function tests** — writing component-level interaction tests that run inside Storybook and can be reused for visual regression + accessibility checks in one pass

## 9.3 Debugging & Profiling
- React DevTools profiler (flamegraphs, ranked charts, interactions timeline)
- `useDebugValue` for custom hook labeling

- **Client Components** (`"use client"`) – interactive parts
- Data fetching: `fetch` with caching (extended `fetch`), `async` components
- Static Site Generation (SSG) – `generateStaticParams`
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) – dynamic rendering per request
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) – `revalidate` and `next.revalidate`
- Streaming with Suspense and `loading.js`, `error.js`
- Server Actions (`"use server"`) for mutations (replaces API routes for forms)
- Middleware (auth, redirects, rewrites, geolocation)
- Image optimization (`next/image`), Font optimization (`next/font`)

- Environment-specific configs (`.env.development`, `.env.production`)
- Custom Webpack loaders/plugins (e.g., `webpack-bundle-analyzer`)
- ESBuild / SWC for faster transpilation
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Browser compatibility & polyfill strategy** — configuring `browserslist` to define supported browser targets and drive both Babel/SWC transpilation and Autoprefixer's CSS output; using `core-js` for selective polyfilling instead of shipping a monolithic polyfill bundle to every user; differential serving (modern `<script type="module">` vs legacy `nomodule` bundle) to avoid penalizing modern-browser users with legacy-browser payload

## 12.2 CI/CD for React
- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI pipelines (build, test, deploy)
- Environment-specific builds (dev/staging/prod with different API URLs)
- Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3 + CloudFront, or serverless
- Docker containerization for SSR apps
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Performance budgets as a CI gate** — enforcing bundle-size limits (`bundlesize`, `size-limit`) and Lighthouse score thresholds directly in the CI pipeline so a PR fails the build if it regresses beyond an agreed budget, rather than performance regressions being caught (or missed) only in post-deploy monitoring

## 12.3 Security in React Apps (Critical for SDE3)
- XSS prevention – never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized data; use DOMPurify if needed
- CSRF protection – SameSite cookies, anti-CSRF tokens
- Content Security Policy (CSP) with React – restricting script sources
- Sanitizing user-generated HTML (DOMPurify, sanitize-html)
- JWT storage – localStorage (vulnerable to XSS) vs httpOnly cookie (vulnerable to CSRF) – trade-offs and best practices (use `SameSite=Strict` + CSRF tokens)
- Preventing prototype pollution (freeze objects, use `Object.create(null)`)
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Supply chain security** — running `npm audit`/Snyk in CI to catch known vulnerabilities in dependencies; lockfile integrity (`package-lock.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml` committed and verified, not regenerated ad hoc); Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes on CDN-loaded third-party scripts so a compromised CDN can't silently serve malicious code; evaluating new dependencies for maintenance status and transitive dependency bloat before adding them
- 🟣 **[GAP-FILL] Cookie consent & privacy compliance** — implementing GDPR/CCPA-compliant consent banners that gate analytics/marketing scripts until explicit consent is given (not just visually hiding a banner while scripts already fired); categorizing scripts (necessary/functional/analytics/marketing) and loading each tier conditionally; consent-state persistence and re-prompting on policy changes

## 12.4 Offline & PWA
- Service workers with Workbox (caching strategies: stale-while-revalidate, network-first)

*(Increasingly asked at Staff+ level since bundling/caching strategy depends directly on transport-layer behavior.)*
- **HTTP/2 multiplexing** – why bundling many small chunks can beat one large bundle over HTTP/2 (contrasted with HTTP/1.1 domain sharding tricks, now legacy)
- **HTTP/3 / QUIC** – reduced connection setup latency, implications for mobile/high-latency networks, and what it means for waterfall-heavy SPAs
- **HTTP caching semantics** – `Cache-Control`, `ETag`/`If-None-Match`, `stale-while-revalidate` at the HTTP layer (distinct from, but complementary to, TanStack Query's in-memory cache)
- **CDN edge caching strategies** for SSR/SSG pages – cache keys, purge/invalidation on deploy, geo-distributed cache warming

# PART 18: SYSTEM DESIGN WITH REACT (SDE3+)

## 18.1 High-Level Design Process (RADIO Method)
- **R**equirements – functional and non-functional (real-time, offline, scale)
- **A**PI design – REST or GraphQL, WebSocket events
- **D**ata model – client-side vs server-side state, cache shapes
- **I**nfrastructure – WebSockets, Redis pub/sub, CDN, load balancers
- **O**perations – scaling, retry logic, reconnection, offline sync

## 18.2 Common System Design Questions

# PART 19: REACT DEVTOOLS & PROFILING DEEP DIVE

## 19.1 Profiler Tab
- Recording interactions and renders
- Flamegraph – understanding render duration and commit phases
- Ranked chart – which components took the longest
- Interactions timeline – user-triggered updates

## 19.2 Components Tab
- Props and state inspection
- Hooks values
- Highlight updates when components render
- Debugging context providers and consumers

## 19.3 Performance Best Practices Checklist
- [ ] Use React DevTools profiler to identify slow components
- [ ] Virtualize long lists
- [ ] Implement `React.memo` for pure components that receive the same props often
- [ ] Avoid inline objects/functions in JSX that break memoization
- [ ] Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to memoized children
- [ ] Code-split routes and heavy components
- [ ] Optimize images and use lazy loading
- [ ] Measure Core Web Vitals with `next/script` (or similar)

# PART 20: REACT INTERNALS DEEP DIVE (🟣 [GAP-FILL] — Staff+ Core Topic)

*This entire part is new. It is consistently the differentiator between SDE3 and Staff+ candidates: knowing how to use concurrent features is SDE3; knowing why they work is Staff+.*

## 20.1 Fiber Architecture
- The Fiber tree – a linked-list-like data structure replacing the old stack reconciler
- Fiber nodes – `type`, `pendingProps`, `memoizedProps`, `alternate`, effect tags
- **Double buffering** – the "current" tree vs the "work-in-progress" tree, and how React swaps them atomically on commit
- Why Fiber enabled interruptible rendering (the old stack reconciler was synchronous and blocking)

## 20.2 Render Phase vs Commit Phase
- **Render phase** – can be paused, aborted, restarted; must be pure (no side effects); this is where `useMemo`-like work happens
- **Commit phase** – synchronous, cannot be interrupted; DOM mutations happen here (`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`, DOM writes, `componentDidMount`/`useLayoutEffect`, then `useEffect` fires asynchronously after paint)
- Why `useEffect` runs after paint but `useLayoutEffect` runs before — and the performance/UX implications of choosing wrong

## 20.3 The Lanes Model (Concurrent Scheduling)
- How React 18+ assigns different "lanes" (priority levels) to different updates — sync, input-continuous, default, transition, idle
- Why a `startTransition` update can be interrupted by a more urgent update (e.g., a keystroke) without losing work
- How this differs from the older "expiration time" priority model in earlier concurrent mode experiments
- Practical implication: why two state updates in the same event handler can end up in different lanes and commit at different times

## 20.4 The Scheduler Package
- React's separate `scheduler` npm package – cooperative scheduling using `MessageChannel` (preferred) or `setTimeout` fallback
- Time slicing – breaking rendering work into ~5ms chunks so the browser can still handle input/paint between chunks
- Relationship between the Scheduler's priority levels and the Lanes model in the reconciler

## 20.5 Reconciliation Algorithm Details
- The diffing heuristics: different component types → full subtree replacement; same type → prop diff and recurse
- Why list diffing without stable keys is O(n) worst-case moves instead of near-O(1) — walking through an actual reorder example
- Why array index as key breaks state association on reorder/insert/delete (concrete before/after example expected at Staff+ interviews)

---

# PART 21: BROWSER RENDERING & PERFORMANCE FUNDAMENTALS (🟣 [GAP-FILL])

*Frontend Staff+ interviews frequently drop into "what does the browser actually do" — this section is the fundamentals React performance work sits on top of.*

## 21.1 Critical Rendering Path
- Parse HTML → build DOM → parse CSS → build CSSOM → combine into render tree → layout (reflow) → paint → composite
- Why render-blocking resources (synchronous `<script>`, blocking CSS) delay first paint
- Preload/prefetch/preconnect and how React 19's built-in asset loading hooks map onto this pipeline

## 21.2 Layout, Paint & Composite
- **Layout thrashing** – reading a layout property (`offsetHeight`, `getBoundingClientRect`) right after writing one, forcing a synchronous reflow; how to batch reads/writes to avoid it
- **Compositor-only properties** – `transform` and `opacity` can animate without triggering layout or paint (GPU compositing); contrast with animating `width`/`top`/`left` which forces layout
- `will-change` – how it hints the browser to promote an element to its own compositor layer, and the memory trade-off of overusing it

## 21.3 Scheduling Primitives
- `requestAnimationFrame` – syncing visual updates to the browser's repaint cycle
- `requestIdleCallback` – deferring low-priority work to idle time (and why React's own Scheduler package doesn't rely on it, preferring `MessageChannel` for more predictable timing)
- How these browser primitives relate to, but are distinct from, React's Lanes/Scheduler model covered in Part 20

# PART 24: 🟣 [GAP-FILL] STAFF+ "SOFT" TECHNICAL SKILLS

*These are frequently the actual bar-raiser at Staff+ loops — technical depth alone doesn't clear the bar without these.*

## 24.1 Technical Writing & Decision Records
- Writing RFCs / architecture decision records (ADRs) for frontend decisions (e.g., "should we adopt RSC," "should we migrate off Redux")
- Structuring a proposal: problem statement, constraints, options considered, trade-offs, recommendation, rollback plan
- Socializing a proposal across teams and handling dissent constructively

## 24.2 Migration Strategy at Scale
- Designing incremental migration paths (e.g., CRA → Vite, Webpack → Rspack, Redux → Zustand, class components → hooks)
- Strangler-fig pattern for large-scale rewrites without a "big bang" cutover
- Feature-flagging a migration so it can be rolled back per-user or per-route
- Measuring migration success (bundle size deltas, performance metrics, error rate before/after)

## 24.3 Cross-Team API Contract Design
- BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) pattern in depth — when a dedicated frontend-facing API layer earns its complexity vs direct microservice calls
- Negotiating and versioning API contracts with backend/platform teams
- Designing for backward compatibility during contract evolution (additive changes, deprecation windows)

## 24.4 Mentoring & Code Review Philosophy
- Calibrating code review depth to the reviewee's level and the risk profile of the change
- Balancing "teaching moments" vs unblocking velocity in review comments
- Structuring 1:1 technical mentoring — pairing, RFC co-authorship, gradually increasing scope of ownership
